abstract: 'Animal brains use the relative timing between sensory cues and behaviorally salient events to form predictive associations about their environment. Handler and colleagues provide new mechanistic insights into how differential signaling downstream of dopamine receptors couples this timing to the dynamic reweighting of synapses that link sensation to action.'
