abstract: "In classical conditioning, animals learn to associate a neutral stimulus (CS) with a reinforcing stimulus (US). Classical conditioning is effective both when CS and US are overlapping in time (delay conditioning) or when there is a temporal gap between the stimuli (trace conditioning). In order to associate non-overlapping stimuli in trace conditioning the sensory systems must keep a neural representation of the first stimulus after its termination (i.e. a stimulus trace). *Drosophila* and other insects are able to solve the olfactory trace conditioning task. However, the neural substrate of the underlying odor trace is not known. To address this issue, we investigated whether and how olfactory information is kept after odor offset along the olfactory pathway of *Drosophila*. Using in vivo calcium imaging and the GAL4/UAS system, with OR83b/Orco, GH146 and MB247 as driver lines, we measured odor evoked activity in three consecutive processing stages: in olfactory receptor neurons and projection neurons of the antennal lobe, and in Kenyon cells of the mushroom body. We analyzed the spatio-temporal response patterns of odor responses and post-odor responses in glomeruli, which are the functional units of the antennal lobe. In both, receptor neurons and projection neurons odors evoked specific response patterns of activated and inhibited glomeruli, which corresponded to the previously described combinatorial response patterns (see http://neuro.uni.kn/DoOR). After odor offset, the odor response patterns turned into prolonged post-odor response patterns of activated and inhibited glomeruli, which were dissimilar to the initial odor response patterns, but still odor specific. Variation of the stimulus length had only minor effects on the post-odor activity patterns. Taken together, these results show that there is a physiological odor trace in the antennal lobe of *Drosophila*. Whether this physiological trace is the substrate of the behavioral trace remains to be determined."
