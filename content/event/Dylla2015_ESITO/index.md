abstract: "In *Drosophila* the cellular and molecular correlates of memory formation after odor-punishment conditioning are well understood. Dopaminergic neurons mediate the reinforcement in odor-punishment learning, and odor-punishment memories are encoded in Kenyon cell output synapses. However, the dynamics of neural plasticity during memory acquisition remain elusive. 


Here, we investigated the dynamics of neural plasticity in the *Drosophila* mushroom body during multiple-trial odor-shock conditioning. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy we imaged calcium responses in different populations of dopaminergic neurons and Kenyon cells. We monitored the experienced electric shock strength for each individual, allowing correlating shock strength with neural responses and neural plasticity. We took advantage of the trace conditioning paradigm in which the odor and the shock application are separated by a few seconds, allowing analyzing the neural responses to odor and shock separately.


We found that odor- and shock-induced calcium responses in dopaminergic neurons and Kenyon cells differed across mushroom body compartments. The experienced shock strength correlated with the calcium response strength in dopaminergic neurons. Repeated stimulation induced a non-associative decrease in the calcium response to odors in both Kenyon cells and dopaminergic neurons, and to shock in dopaminergic neurons. Pairing odor and shock stimuli during conditioning counteracted the non-associative decrease in response strength to the odor stimulus in dopaminergic neurons, but not in Kenyon cells, suggesting an associative plasticity effect in dopaminergic neurons. The strength and the dynamics of associative plasticity differed across different types of dopaminergic neurons. 


Understanding the dynamics and heterogeneity of associative and non-associative plasticity in dopaminergic neurons and Kenyon cells in the mushroom body may provide critical insight into the neural mechanisms of stimulus-punishment learning in insects."
