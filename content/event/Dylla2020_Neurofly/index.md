abstract: "To investigate the mechanisms underlying sensory experience-dependent changes in behavior and perception, we studied how chronic exposure of *Drosophila melanogaster* to an odor affects its behavioral responses towards that odor, using a naturalistic behavioral task. Young flies were exposed for two days to natural odors, and their behavior towards those specific odors was evaluated one day later using a trap assay. The dynamics of the flies’ arrival, exploration, and entry into the traps were measured using machine vision enabled fly tracking. When allowed to choose between two traps, each baited with a different odor, flies exposed to appetitive odors like banana or pineapple selectively entered the trap baited with the exposure odor earlier and at higher frequency compared to control flies. However, the time of first landing and number of landings on a trap was similar across all groups of flies, suggesting that prior odor experience did not affect the ability of flies to detect the odor. In a complementary experiment, flies exposed to an aversive odor, onion, exited an environment odorized with onion less frequently compared to flies exposed to other natural odors. These results show that odor exposure in early life under naturalistic conditions can change behavioral responses towards that odor. They also suggest that early exposure may affect the meaning of the odor to the animal, for instance, by increasing its appetitiveness and/or decreasing its perceived associated risk. We propose that changes in olfactory behavior driven by odor experience are likely encoded in higher olfactory areas."
