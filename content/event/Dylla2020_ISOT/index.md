abstract: "Sensory experiences in early life shape our perception of the world as adults. Animals, including the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, show altered behavioral responses toward an odor when raised in an environment where that odor is abundant. This has been demonstrated using high concentrations of monomolecular odorants, which are uncommon in nature. We studied (1) the effects of chronic exposure to an odor on behavioral responses towards that odor, using naturalistic paradigms; and (2) the behavioral mechanisms underlying these effects.

We exposed young flies for two days to the odors from either banana or onion. Their behavior towards each odor was then tested using a modified trap assay; we monitored the dynamics of the flies’ foraging behavior at the trap entrance, using custom tracking software, as well as the time of entry into each trap. 

Irrespective of prior experience, flies entered the banana trap more than the onion trap. The average time of first landing and the number of landings on either trap was independent of prior experience. These results suggest that prior odor experience does not affect how flies detect the odor. However, banana-exposed flies inspected the entrance holes of the banana trap earlier, and entered the banana trap much sooner, than onion-exposed or non-exposed flies. 

Our results show that odor exposure in early life under naturalistic conditions can change behavioral responses towards that odor. Our results also suggest that early exposure affects the meaning of the odor to the animal, for instance, by increasing its appetitiveness and/or decreasing its perceived associated risk, and thereby lowering the behavioral threshold to enter the trap. We propose that changes in olfactory behavior driven by odor experience are likely encoded in higher olfactory areas."
