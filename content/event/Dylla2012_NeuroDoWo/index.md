abstract: "Learning and memory has mostly been studied by analyzing groups of animals, both on the behavioral and physiological level. However, group behavior does not necessarily reflect individual behavior. Thus, studying the mechanisms of learning and memory, one should analyze behavior and physiology within individual animals. I am interested in the neuronal changes underlying odor-heat punishment learning in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. To address this issue, I chose a combined approach, allowing the parallel observation - and thus the correlation - of behavioral (1) and physiological (2) changes.

1)	Using a walking ball setup, I measure the locomotive activity of a single fly during aversive olfactory conditioning. Here the presentation of an odor is combined with laser-heat punishment leading to an avoidance behavior to this particular odor. 

2)	Learning induced alterations in behavior are based on physiological changes. Since Drosophila melanogaster exhibits a wealth of genetic tools it is easily possible for me to detect stimuli- and learning-induced changes also on the neuronal level using optical imaging.  


First results show that flies respond to stimuli either with directed (appetitive odors) or increased (heat punishment) locomotion on the ball.   


Still several modifications are required to accomplish the parallel operation of the walking ball and the optical imaging setup in a single fly but finally this combined approach will enable me to directly link behavioral with physiological alterations. That way, I will be able to distinguish between learning and non-learning related neural activity."
